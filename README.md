1. Introduction
This repository aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of LSTM, Ichimoku Cloud, and FinBERT, which are essential tools for analyzing stock market , making predictions, and gaining insights from the markets data.

2. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to work with sequences of data. In the context of finance, LSTMs can be used for tasks such as time series forecasting, volatility prediction, and sentiment analysis.

3. Ichimoku Cloud
Ichimoku Cloud, also known as Ichimoku Kinko Hyo, is a versatile technical analysis tool originating from Japan. It provides insights into support and resistance levels, trend direction, and potential buy/sell signals. Traders and analysts often use the Ichimoku Cloud to make informed decisions about market entry and exit points.


4. FinBERT
FinBERT is a pre-trained language model specifically designed for financial sentiment analysis. It's based on the BERT architecture and fine-tuned on financial text data. FinBERT can be used to analyze news articles, social media posts, and other textual data to gauge market sentiment and potential impacts on asset prices.
